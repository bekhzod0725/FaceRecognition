# Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks
## Using Scikit/Skflow, Tensorflow and NumPy

Project was done using Google's Tensorflow API for Deep Learning algorithms. In addition, Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Scikit-Learn are  needed to run the programs.

### Contents
The project consists of the following:
1. LFW: Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset facial recognition
    - For more info visit: LFW Website
2. Lookalike: Lookalike people dataset
    - The dataset contains the images of celebrities and their lookalikes. The task is to differentiate the actual people from their impostors.
 
 Lookalike People's dataset is attached to this project for convenience. In order to run the lookalike.py file, LADatabase.rar has to be extracted into the same folder where lookalike.py, lookalike_ext.py, and load_data.py are located.
